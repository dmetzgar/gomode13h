This is the source code for my blog at http://mode19.net

Originally, I wrote a custom ASP.NET application for my blog. Later, I converted that to ASP.NET Core. But I've never needed anything 
server side for the site, so a static site seemed more appealing. That's why a static site generator like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is 
appealing. This repo contains the source code, including the posts written in Markdown and images, for my blog using Hugo.
